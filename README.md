# Binary Classifiers performance metrics comparison

Predictive maintenance (PdM) is designed to assist companies to determine the time for repair
or changing the manufacturing parts right before being out of order. The main approach of
PdM is to reduce the future down-time costs of the device due to unexpected failures. In order
to achieve the approach with a good prediction having accurate information on the right time
is necessary. This information will be collected by different sensors installed on the equipment
helping PdM to improve performance in real-time. Accurate prediction with the collected then
cleaned data required a proper model which will be able to calculate the risk (probability) of
failure for a machine in each series of time. Selecting a proper model requires practice due to
having different specification and complexity of each algorithm.

Data prepration:

Transforming the raw data to an exposable and more accessible set of data through analyzing for improving the quality is called data preparation. For data preparation knowing the data types is important. 

Data wrangling:

The following table is a head of the collected raw data for 100 engines of planes which needs cleaning to be ready to use in the modeling processes (Garca, Luengo, & Herrera, 2014). As the table shows the training data with:

•	28 columns (with 20631 rows from the shape)

•	Missing data (there is no missing data in the data set)

•	No name columns

•	Extra space columns

Exploratory data analysis (EDA):

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) applies mostly visual techniques analyzing the data to determine how the data should carry out. (Nisbet, Miner, & Yale, 2017) The purpose of EDA approaches is to:

•	dataset insight maximization

•	explore the underlying structures

•	important variables extraction

•	outliers and anomalies detection

•	optimal factors detection
