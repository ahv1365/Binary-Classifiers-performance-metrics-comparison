# Binary Classifiers performance metrics comparison

Predictive maintenance (PdM) is designed to assist companies to determine the time for repair
or changing the manufacturing parts right before being out of order. The main approach of
PdM is to reduce the future down-time costs of the device due to unexpected failures. In order
to achieve the approach with a good prediction having accurate information on the right time
is necessary. This information will be collected by different sensors installed on the equipment
helping PdM to improve performance in real-time. Accurate prediction with the collected then
cleaned data required a proper model which will be able to calculate the risk (probability) of
failure for a machine in each series of time. Selecting a proper model requires practice due to
having different specification and complexity of each algorithm.

The objective of this case study is to improve the maintenance operations by comparing the
different binary classifiers according to their scores within a time window and find the most
accurate and precise model. The project applies data science techniques and machine
learning algorithms by using python libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy.
